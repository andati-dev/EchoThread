# Frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind)

- Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- UI scaffolding is in `src/` (App, main, styles)

Note: if `npm install` fails due to specific package versions (e.g., Tailwind), try updating the devDependency to a published version or run `npm i tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer` to install compatible versions.

Next: implement auth flows, posts, comments, and voting UI, integrate with backend APIs.
